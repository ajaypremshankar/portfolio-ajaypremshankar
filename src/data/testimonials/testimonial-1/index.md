Ajay consistently exhibits openness to learn and to tread upon unexplored paths. His prime abilities include courage to accept challenges, sense of complete ownership of work, commitment to meet deadlines and questioning the status-quo. I did not see him ever saying 'no' to a work on the grounds that he is not familiar with it.

He recently took upon task to study JS as a full-time programming language and conducted a series of sessions for entire team of 10 Java development engineers that includes veterans upto 10-years industry experience. He was not only well-received but also came out as a ferocious and influencing presenter.
