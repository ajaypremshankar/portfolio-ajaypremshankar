Ajay was a game-changer in my professional growth. His understanding of my struggles was immense and helped me grow exponentially.
Every time we connected, the breakthrough I had was incredible.
I feel that I have grown as a professional and his inputs strengthened me and my work.
His focus on basics, work-life balance, and consistency were some of many take away from him.
I truly idealize his work.
His words made sense to the problem I was encountering and also led my way to find the solution.
Under his guidance, I could make few difficult decisions about my career and he was kind enough of taking the constant follow-up.
I find my journey a rewarding one, the amount of progress I have made in my outlook to my profession is something I am going to carry forward, and will be thankful to my mentor.
In my struggle, I found a profound strength and a friend as a mentor in the past year.
